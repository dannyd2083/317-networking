We believe that there is a bug in the accept_new_socket, after we created a passive socket, binded it 
with a port and set it to listen to the client (in new_passive_socket). We have worked on it for hours
and went to the TA's office hour but still couldn't figure it out. Although the functionality might fail,
it would be great if you could take a look at our code and give partial marks if possible.
